# Gas-Detection-System 
This project is a gas detection system using the **MQ-6 sensor** and **ATmega32 microcontroller**.It includes hardware design, PCB layout, and assembly programming.  

## Features  
This system detects flammable gases such as LPG, Methane, and Propane using the MQ-6 sensor. It provides real-time gas concentration display on an LCD and triggers LED alerts when dangerous levels are detected.Designed using **KiCad** and programmed in **Assembly (AVR)**, it ensures low power consumption and can be adapted for both home and industrial applications.
